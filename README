The default iPhone-theme

Here is the possible default iphone-theme (layout for iPhone or other mobile devices), a template of Tumblr. Since Tumblr does not publish the original, I had to do some reverse engineering things before making the page available.

fetzig edit: since there was an update in the default theme i updated it :). thx for the great work orangkucing.

To install the theme, first go to that page and copy all of the text there. Next follow the instruction below:

staff says:

We just added a hook so you can override the default iPhone layout by adding a Custom Layout page with the url /iphone-theme. Have fun!
That’s all.

As you can see, nothing will happen to your iPhone+Tumblr after this theme is installed for this is the DEFAULT. But I think the template here will be your good starting point for creating really cool themes.
